### Core Stack ⚙️

- **Frontend**: [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) 💎 - React-like simplicity, unmatched performance
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 🎨 + [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) 🌼 - Utility-first beauty
- **Backend**: [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) 🗄️ - Open source backend in a single file
- **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ⚡ - Next generation frontend tooling
- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 🚀 - All-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit

## Overview 🌟

This project serves as a starting point for small, static web applications or extensions to existing projects. Whether you're adding just a tiny JavaScript snippet or building a full Single Page Application (SPA), this stack is designed to be as simple as possible while providing robust functionality.

The stack shines when used together with [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) — your "Open Source backend in 1 file" offering features such as:

- **Realtime Database** 🔄
- **Authentication** 🔐
- **File Storage** 📁
- **Admin Dashboard** 🖥️

With PocketBase, you can easily construct a full-stack application complete with user management, backups, job scheduling, and more. Alternatively, you can use this stack purely on the frontend.

The idea is to leverage **standardized languages, libraries, tools, and frameworks** to lower the entry barrier—even for developers with limited IT background.  
While languages like Elm or Gleam might offer superior type-safety for complex applications, PocketBase (written in Go) strikes a balance for a powerful yet simple backend solution.  
Combined with TypeScript, SolidJS, and a vibrant ecosystem of libraries, you'll have a practical and maintainable environment for rapid development.

## Key Features ✨

- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript Support** - Full TypeScript integration with strict type checking
- **Responsive Design Framework** - Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes for responsive layouts
- **Component Library** - DaisyUI components with custom "solidarity" themes in light and dark modes
- **Blazing Fast Development** - Hot Module Reloading (HMR) with Vite and lightning-fast bundle times with Bun
- **Advanced Animation Support** - Built-in animations with Auto Animate, Swapy, and Intersection Observer utilities
- **Accessibility** - Accessible components using Kobalte UI primitives
- **Icon System** - Thousands of icons from multiple libraries via Iconify integration
- **State Management** - Multiple options from simple signals to XState for complex state machines
- **Production Optimization** - Built-in compression, code splitting, and performance optimizations
- **Docker Support** - Multi-architecture Docker images for easy deployment
- **CI/CD Integration** - GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building, and deployment

## CI/CD Pipeline 🔄

This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying your application.

### Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of these main jobs:

1. **Build Job** - Builds and validates the application
2. **Deploy Pages** - Deploys the frontend to GitHub Pages
3. **Deploy Docker** - Builds and publishes multi-architecture Docker images

### Trigger Events

The workflow runs on:

- **Push to main branch** - Triggers full build and deployment
- **Pull requests to main** - Runs build and tests only
- **Release tags** - Triggered when you push a version tag (`v*.*.*`)
- **Manual trigger** - Can be run on-demand from GitHub Actions tab

### Detailed Job Breakdown

#### 1. Build Job

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # Setup and dependency installation steps
    - name: Checkout Repository
    - name: Setup Go
    - name: Setup Bun
    - name: Cache Bun Dependencies
    - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
    - name: Install Backend Dependencies

    # Quality and security checks
    - name: Security Scan Dependencies
    - name: Run Type Check
    - name: Run Format Check
    - name: Run Tests
    - name: Build Fullstack Application
    - name: Run Lint Check

    # Artifact creation for other jobs
    - name: Upload Frontend Artifact
    - name: Upload Go Binaries
```

This job sets up the environment, installs dependencies with caching for performance, runs various code quality checks, builds the application, and saves the build artifacts for use in subsequent jobs.

#### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  environment:
    name: github-pages
    url: ${{steps.deployment.outputs.page_url}}
  steps:
    - name: Download Frontend Artifact
    - name: Copy index.html to 404.html for SPA fallback
    - name: Setup Pages
    - name: Upload artifact
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

This job deploys the frontend to GitHub Pages, but only when changes are pushed to the main branch. It also creates a 404.html page that redirects to the main application, enabling proper client-side routing for SPAs.

#### 3. Deploy Docker Image

```yaml
deploy-docker:
  needs: build
  name: Publish Docker Image
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
    - name: Extract Version
    - name: Log in to GitHub Packages
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
    - name: Cache Docker layers
    - name: Scan Docker image for vulnerabilities
    - name: Build and push Docker image
```

This job builds and publishes multi-architecture Docker images to GitHub Packages. It runs on pushes to main or when version tags are created. The job also:

- Extracts version information from git tags
- Sets up Docker Buildx for multi-architecture builds
- Scans for security vulnerabilities with Trivy
- Caches Docker layers for faster builds
- Publishes images with proper version tagging

### Using the CI/CD Workflow

#### Configuration Required

To use this workflow in your own project:

1. **Set up GitHub repository secrets**:

   - `GH_PACKAGES_USERNAME` - GitHub username with package write permissions
   - `GH_PACKAGES_PASSWORD` - GitHub personal access token with package write permissions
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` (optional) - For dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source

3. **Configure Docker registry**:
   - Make sure your GitHub Container Registry is enabled
   - Update the Docker image name in the workflow:
     ```yaml
     tags: |
       ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO:${{ steps.version.outputs.TAG }}
       ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO:latest
     ```

#### Creating Versioned Releases

To create a versioned release with proper Docker image tagging:

```bash
# Tag a new version
git tag v1.0.0

# Push the tag to trigger the workflow
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will create a Docker image tagged with both `latest` and `v1.0.0`.

#### Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow by:

- Adding test coverage reporting
- Integrating with notification services (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Setting up deployment to additional environments (staging, production)
- Adding performance testing or load testing
- Implementing canary deployments or blue-green deployment strategies

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Build failures**: Check logs for specific error messages
- **Deployment failures**: Verify GitHub Pages is properly configured
- **Docker push failures**: Check credentials and repository permissions
- **Security scan alerts**: Review and fix identified vulnerabilities

The CI/CD workflow is designed to catch issues early in the development process and provide a smooth path to production deployment.

## Deployment Options 🌐

This project can be deployed in several ways:

### 1. Static Site (Frontend Only)

For a purely static frontend deployment, build the project and deploy the generated files:

```bash
bun run frontend:build
```

Deploy the generated `dist` folder to any static site hosting service like:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

### 2. Docker Deployment (Full Stack)

The project includes a robust, multi-stage Dockerfile for containerized deployment of both frontend and PocketBase backend:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t simple-frontend-stack .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8161:8161 simple-frontend-stack
```

#### Docker Image Tagging Scheme

Pre-built Docker images are available from GitHub Container Registry with the following tags:

- `latest` - Built from the `main` branch
- `vX.Y.Z` - Built from release tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- `branch-name` - Built from branches (e.g., `branch-feature-xyz`)
- `pr-123` - Built from pull requests (e.g., `pr-123`)

You can pull these images directly for testing:

```bash
# Pull latest stable version
docker pull ghcr.io/yertools/simple-frontend-stack:latest

# Pull specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/yertools/simple-frontend-stack:v1.0.0

# Pull from a branch
docker pull ghcr.io/yertools/simple-frontend-stack:branch-feature-xyz

# Pull from a pull request
docker pull ghcr.io/yertools/simple-frontend-stack:pr-123
```

#### Docker Deployment Features

The Docker implementation includes several production-ready features:

- **Multi-stage build** for minimal image size
- **Non-root user** for enhanced security
- **Health checks** for container orchestration platforms
- **Volume mounts** for data persistence:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8161:8161 \
    -v ./pb_data:/app/pb_data \
    -v ./pb_public:/app/pb_public \
    -v ./pb_hooks:/app/pb_hooks \
    -v ./pb_migrations:/app/pb_migrations \
    simple-frontend-stack
  ```
- **Environment variable support**:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8161:8161 \
    -e APP_ENV=production \
    -e DEBUG=false \
    simple-frontend-stack
  ```
- **Multi-architecture support** for various platforms:
  ```bash
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -t simple-frontend-stack . --push
  ```
